## Description
Just a Simple simulation of some of the circuits in Digital Systems 2
The current version [v.3.0] is the latest version i have developed; it has only flipflops, a combinational logic circuit and truthable generator
The aim is to create two versions, a test-safe version [with auto generated input or just demonstrations] and a version that can actually do the math/logic on behalf of the user. with input fields.
