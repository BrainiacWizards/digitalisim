# DigitaliSim

## Description

Digitalisim is a simple simulation of some circuits in Digital Systems. The current version (v.3.0) includes flip-flops, a combinational logic circuit, and a truth table generator. The aim is to create two versions: a test-safe version with auto-generated input or demonstrations, and a version that can perform math/logic operations based on user input, but friednly to be used in open book tests.
